## Why {syncdr}? 

**{syncdr}** is an R package for handling and synchronizing files and directories. Its primary objectives are:

1.  To provide a clear snapshot of the content and status of synchronization between two directories under comparison: including their tree structure, their common files, and files that are exclusive to either directory
2.  To help make file handling in R easier: Enabling content-based and modification date-based file comparisons, as well as facilitating tasks such as duplicate identification, file copying, moving, and deletion *(todo: better describe this point later on depending on functionalities)* .
