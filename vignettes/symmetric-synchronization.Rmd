```

This article covers functions designed for symmetric synchronization between two directories.

## What is symmetric synchronization?

This is a **two-way** synchronization: this means that you compare both directories and update each other to reflect the latest changes: If a file is added, modified, or deleted in one directory, the corresponding action is taken in the other directory. This approach is useful when you want both directories to be always **up-to-date** with the latest changes, regardless of where those changes originate.

**To keep in mind:**

When calling these synchronization functions, you can provide inputs in two *alternative* ways:

1.  Specify paths of both left and right directories, as well as the \`by_date\` and \`by_content\` arguments as you wish the synchronization to be performed (if not specified, by default \`by_date = TRUE\` and \`by_content\` = FALSE) *OR*

2.  First call the workhorse function \`compare_directories()\` to obtain the sync_status object. Then, provide it as input to the synchronization function. You do not need to specify the 'by_date' and 'by_content' arguments, as they will automatically be determined depending on the 'sync_status'.

## Types of symmetric synchronization

Similar to its asymmetric counterpart, `syncdr` enables the execution of ***specific symmetric synchronizations*** with predefined options, allowing you to select the most suitable function based on your requirements.

: Types of symmetric synchronization

Let's consider the following examples:

##### \*️⃣ **Note: `verbose = TRUE`**

As with asymmetric synchronization, also here you have the option to enable verbose mode by setting `verbose = TRUE`. This will display the tree structure of *both* directories BEFORE and AFTER the synchronization.

**1 - Full symmetric synchronization:**

**When comparing directories by date and content:**

```{r}

sync_status <- compare_directories(left_path  = left,
                                   right_path = right,
                                   by_content = TRUE)

full_symmetric_sync(sync_status,
                    by_content = TRUE,
                    verbose    = TRUE)
```

**When comparing directories by date only:**

```{r include = FALSE}

.syncdrenv.1 <- copy_temp_environment()

# Get left and right directories' paths 
left  <- .syncdrenv.1$left
right <- .syncdrenv.1$right

```

```{r}

sync_status <- compare_directories(left_path  = left,

**2 - Partial symmetric synchronization:**

```{r include = FALSE}

.syncdrenv.2 <- copy_temp_environment()

# Get left and right directories' paths 
left  <- .syncdrenv.2$left
right <- .syncdrenv.2$right

```

```{r}

                                   right_path = right)

                                    verbose = TRUE)
